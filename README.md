# Mandelbrot
This is a project involved with Maths were I re-create the Mandelbrot set with help of complex numbers and C# knowledge.

## What to know
The whole project is built in Swedish, but you might understand the code if you know the basics of the Mandelbrot set :)<br><br>This project does *not* zoom in the mandelbrot set ([like those in youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD2XgQOyCCk&)). It's just a visual picture of the first set of the mandelbrot.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE used to develop the program

## Authors

* **Niklas Rydkvist** - *Mandelbrot* - [Nojze](https://github.com/Nojze)
