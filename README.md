# Mandelbrot
This is a project for an assignment I had in maths, were I decided to do a Mandelbrot set with help of complex numbers and some C# code.

## What to know
The whole project is commented in Swedish, but you might understand the code if you know the basics of the Mandelbrot set hehe :)<br><br>This project does *not* zoom in the mandelbrot set (like those in youtube). It's just a visual picture of the first set of the mandelbrot!
